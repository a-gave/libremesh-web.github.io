== Download Precompiled Binaries

We offer a list of precompiled firmware images with **generic settings**. This is the easiest way to first test and install LiMe in your router.

* The current **stable tested release** is Community Chaos, images can be found at http://downloads.libremesh.org/community_chaos[downloads] site.

* The current **release candidate** is Dayboot Rely, images can be found at the official http://repo.libremesh.org/[repository].

== Use the Chef Application (recommended)

Chef is our own web application for generating customized firmware images.

https://chef.altermundi.net[Chef homepage.]

== Installation procedure

For installation procedure read our link:docs/en_quick_starting_guide.html[Quick Starting Guide].

== Cook your own firmware using lime-sdk

_lime-sdk_ is a tool to easily compile locally a firmware image. It allows you to customize libremesh at your own needs.

Install build dependencies, for example on a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution install the following packages:

----
sudo apt-get install subversion zlib1g-dev gawk flex unzip bzip2 gettext build-essential libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev binutils cpp psmisc docbook-to-man wget git
----

Download lime-sdk git repository:
----
git clone https://github.com/libremesh/lime-sdk.git
cd lime-sdk
----

And follow the steps to generate the firmware. See https://github.com/libremesh/lime-sdk/blob/master/README.md[lime-sdk README]

== Compile the Code Using Pristine OpenWrt buildroot
