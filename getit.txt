== Download Precompiled Binaries

We offer a list of precompiled firmware images with **generic settings**. This is the easiest way to first test and install LiMe in your router.

* The current **stable tested release** is Community Chaos, images can be found at http://downloads.libremesh.org/community_chaos[downloads] site.

* For the development version of LiMe including experimental features, you can use the automatic generated, not tested, images from http://builds.libremesh.org/develop[Lime-Build develop].

== Use the Chef Application (recommended)

Chef is our own web application for generating customized firmware images.

https://chef.altermundi.net[Chef homepage.]

== Installation procedure

* Find the download for your router by name or model number. You may need to search different variations or aliases. You can find more detailed router model instructions https://wiki.lede-project.org/toh/start[here].

* If you are installing for the first time, choose the link ending with `-factory.bin`. If you are upgrading an existing install, choose the link ending with `-sysupgrade.bin`.

* Once downloaded, connect your router via ethernet and log into your router's admin. First, you will need to identify the IP address for the router. You can go to the terminal use `netstat -rn` (mac), or `ip route show default` (linux), then find the IP address for the router. More details on finding your router's ip can be found http://www.howtogeek.com/233952/how-to-find-your-routers-ip-address-on-any-computer-smartphone-or-tablet/[here] and http://www.computerworld.com/article/2474776/wireless-networking/network-security-find-the-ip-address-of-your-home-router.html[here].

* Log into the router administration interface with the IP via web browser such as Firefox or Chromium: `http://<your_router_ip>/`. You may need to modify the IP by replacing the last set with 1. For example if the IP is `10.138.21.216`, try `10.138.21.1`. Another option is replacing previous set with a zero, so `10.138.21.216` would become `10.138.0.1`.

* Once you've logged in, find the `Flash new firmware image` option. 
NOTE: ensure that `Keep Settings` is UNCHECKED. It is checked by default. Then click choose file, and navigate to the location of the file you've downlaoded. Then click `Flash Image`.


== Compile Using the Tool lime-build

_lime-build_ is a tool to easily compile locally a firmware image. It also creates a development environment.

Install build dependencies, for example on a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution install the following packages:

----
sudo apt-get install subversion zlib1g-dev gawk flex unzip bzip2 gettext build-essential libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev binutils cpp psmisc docbook-to-man wget git
----

Download lime-build git repository:
----
git clone https://github.com/libremesh/lime-build.git
cd lime-build
----

You can see the list of officially supported targets (see our link:docs/hardware/index.html[supported hardware page]) and profiles (sets of LibreMesh packages) by typing:
----
make info
----

To compile a target/profile just execute (example):
----
make T=ar71xx P=generic
----

[NOTE]
================
* _T_ is the target related to the hardware type.

* _P_ is the profile related to the software combination of LibreMesh packets.

* A successful build relies on a stable network connection. If the build fails, simply try again or add the option `J=1` if you don't mind waiting longer.
================

You will find the binaries ready to install in _output_ directory.

See the https://github.com/libremesh/lime-build/blob/develop/README.md[lime-build README] for more information and options.

== Compile the Code Using Pristine OpenWrt buildroot
