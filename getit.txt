== Download it: The firmware selector

At this page you can search for your router model and download the adequate file: "factory", for the first installation, or "sysupgrade", for replacing OpenWrt or from an older LibreMesh version:

https://repo.libremesh.org/selector/

If no result is displayed, please select the "mini" version from the list of the available LibreMesh versions and search again.

For finding all the LibreMesh firmware images, including old versions, check out this page:

https://repo.libremesh.org/

To find the right file to use, please refer to the OpenWrt wiki, see their link:https://openwrt.org/toh/start[Table of Hardware here].

== Build it online: The firmware selector with custom packages

After selecting the LibreMesh version and the router model on the https://repo.libremesh.org/selector[LibreMesh firmware selector page], you will see a "Customize installed packages and/or first boot script" button. Click it and you will be able to add or remove packages to the firmware.

Also, you can add custom configuration adding the package of a https://libremesh.org/development-network_profiles.html[network profile] (for example, the package of the network profile for the "calafou" community and the "indoor2" type will be named `profile-calafou-indoor2`).

Additionally, you can add BASH commands to be run just after flashing the LibreMesh firmware in the "Script to run on first boot (uci-defaults)" section.

When you are happy with the settings, press "Request build" and the system will compile a new LibreMesh image just for you!

== Build it locally: The OpenWrt buildroot with the LibreMesh modules

Refer to the link:development.html[Development] page, use the v2024.1 tag and use OpenWrt 23.05.5 for compiling the latest release: *LibreMesh 2024.1 Fantastic Forwarder*.
