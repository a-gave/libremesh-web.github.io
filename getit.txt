== Download Precompiled Binaries

We offer a list of precompiled firmware images with **generic settings**. This is the easiest way to first test and install LiMe in your router.

* The current **stable release** is Dayboot Rely (17.06), images can be found at the http://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/17.06/[downloads] site.

* The previous (old) **stable release** is Community Chaos (16.07), images can be still be found at http://downloads.libremesh.org/community_chaos[downloads] site.

== Installation procedure

For installation procedure read our link:docs/en_quick_starting_guide.html[Quick Starting Guide].

== Cook your own firmware using lime-sdk

_lime-sdk_ is a tool to easily compile locally a firmware image. It allows you to customize libremesh at your own needs.

Install build dependencies, for example on a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution install the following packages:

----
sudo apt-get install subversion zlib1g-dev gawk flex unzip bzip2 gettext build-essential libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev binutils cpp psmisc docbook-to-man wget git
----

Download lime-sdk git repository:
----
git clone https://github.com/libremesh/lime-sdk.git
cd lime-sdk
----

And follow the steps to generate the firmware. See https://github.com/libremesh/lime-sdk/blob/master/README.md[lime-sdk README]

== Compile the Code Using Pristine OpenWrt buildroot

Refer to https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages[lime-packages README].

== Outdated: Use the Chef Application (only for old release Community Chaos 16.07)

Chef is our own web application for generating customized firmware images. The latest release (Dayboot Rely 17.06) is not included yet, so right now it's only possible to generate customized firmwares based on Community Chaos 16.07. We plan at some point to integrate Dayboot Rely 17.06 into Chef, so that it can be used again.
