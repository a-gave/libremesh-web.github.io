The LibreMesh project
======================

== Introduction to LibreMesh

LibreMesh is a modular framework for creating OpenWrt/LEDE-based firmwares for wireless mesh nodes. Several communities around the world use LibreMesh as the foundation of their local mesh firmwares.

The LibreMesh project includes the development of several tools.
The **firmware** (the main piece) will allow simple deployment of auto-configurable, yet versatile, multi-radio mesh networks.

== Mesh Networks

Mesh networks are such networks where all participants (nodes) are able to route traffic from other participants. 
So there are not central points and the physical topology can be completely random.
Usually mesh networks are decentralized, bottom-up organized, deployed and maintained by the people using them.
We believe this is the only way for achieving a real free network out of control for the governments or big organizations.

== Free Networks

We understand a free network as a telecommunications network which accomplish three points:

* It is open, so anyone can connect to it if physically possible
* It is neutral, so there are not preferences for the kind, origin or destination of the data
* It is free as the Spanish word libre, so there are not restrictions

== Firmware and Embedded Device

An embedded device is a small computer. Usually the operating system running in such small computers is called Firmware.
Our way of deploying free mesh networks is by installing our own firmware to the devices (usually WiFi routers).
Our system is based on the OpenWrt/LEDE project, which at the same time is based on the well known Linux operating system.
Everyting we develop is **free software** so anyone can use, copy, modify and distribute it with no restrictions.

== History

The LibreMesh project (LiMe) was started in 2013 by a set of free network activists from several countries and different projects around the world, willing to create a common solution for the deployment of free/mesh networks.
