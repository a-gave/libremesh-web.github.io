Network Profiles
===========

Network profiles are the most convenient way for a community to organize its configuration files. During the link:development.html[compilation process], the users can select the desired network profile, which will automatically select all the needed software and include the configuration files for this community.

Practically, each community can create a folder in the https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles[network-profiles repository] with the community's name, and, inside this, create one or more profiles (for example you can have different profiles for nodes of the backbone or access points).


In Network profiles is interesting set the file: root/etc/config/lime-community to have the domain name of the community.

The buildroot has a directory called files/ where we overwrite our configuration files from our Network profile.
For example:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rsync -aPh --delete ~/network-profiles/valsamoggia.ninux.org/vs-ninux-generic/files/ ~/openwrt/files/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
