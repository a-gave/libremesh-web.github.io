Network Profiles
================

Network profiles are the most convenient way for a community to organize its configuration files. During the link:development.html[compilation process], the users can select the desired network profile, which will automatically select all the needed software and include the configuration files for this community.

Practically, each community can create a folder in the https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles[network-profiles repository] with the community's name, and, inside this, create one or more profiles (for example you can have different profiles for nodes of the backbone or access points).

= How to create a Network Profile

You will need to create a new folder with some content in the https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles[network-profiles repository].

In order to do that, you will need to create a Github user, fork the https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles[network-profiles repository], clone your fork on a computer, create the directories, create a +Makefile+, add some content in the +root/+ folder (for example some custom configuration file), commit the changes, push them to your forked repository and finally open a pull request from your repository to the official https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles[network-profiles one].

Here we will skip the explanation on the git-related steps, please search on the internet how to perform them or ask us on the link:communication.html[project's communication channels].

== Adding files to the "root" folder

In Network profiles is interesting set the file: root/etc/config/lime-community to have the domain name of the community.

== Selecting packages

The Network Profile get converted to packages which, as mentioned above, will include some files but can also select some new software to be installed as a dependency.



== Alternative to the usage of Network Profiles

Using a network profile is a convenient way to share the files over the internet with all the other members of your community; but it can be exhaggerated if you just want to test adding a file from time to time.

In the buildroot (which is the system that you can use for compiling LibreMesh as described in the link:development.html[development page]) you can create a directory named +files+, and the content of this directory will, in the final LibreMesh image, overwrite every file with the same path and name, including the ones from the selected Network Profile.

For example:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd openwrt
mkdir files
rsync -aPh --delete ~/network-profiles/valsamoggia.ninux.org/vs-ninux-generic/root/ files/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
