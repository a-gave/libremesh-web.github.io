For the year 2023, we decided to meet the "first Saturday of the month, every two months", so:

* Saturday the 4th of February 2023 at 13:00 UTC (14:00 CET, 9:00 ART).
* Saturday the 1st of April 2023 at 13:00 UTC (15:00 CEST, 9:00 ART).
* Saturday the 3rd of June 2023 at 13:00 UTC (15:00 CEST, 9:00 ART).
* Saturday the 5th of August 2023 at 13:00 UTC (15:00 CEST, 9:00 ART).
* Saturday the 7th of October 2023 at 13:00 UTC (15:00 CEST, 9:00 ART).
* Saturday the 2th of December 2023 at 13:00 UTC (14:00 CET, 9:00 ART).

You can freely partecipate as listener, but.. the link of the meeting pass in chat and via mailinglist just at the end of the month before.
You can also add topics at the meeting, but we prefer that inform us before brings them.
During the meetings we use this format:
  * we prefer have a list of the topics to discuss before the meeting,
  * we do report for the people that can't be present in the assembly,
  * we use a pad for a collaborative reporting of discussion and decisions,
  * we take the time of the speakers to not have unique long speeches
  * we decide at the begin of every meeting the languages that we use, so sometimes our assembly are in different languages because people understand more than what they speak (italoportish) and sometimes we use english.
  * we not decide for majority and for do-cracy, we try to reach consensus and we are friendly in the conversations, but to be honest we are not already established a written "decision making workflow".
