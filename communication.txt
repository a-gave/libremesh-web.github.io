You can freely partecipate as listener, but.. the link of the meeting pass in chat and via mailinglist just at the end of the month before.

You can also add topics at the meeting, but we prefer that inform us before brings them.

During the meetings we use this format:

* we prefer have a list of the topics to discuss before the meeting,
* we do report for the people that can't be present in the assembly,
* we use a pad for a collaborative reporting of discussion and decisions,
* we take the time of the speakers to not have unique long speeches
* we decide at the begin of every meeting the languages that we use, so sometimes our assembly are in different languages because people understand more than what they speak (italoportish) and sometimes we use english.
* we not decide for majority and for do-cracy, we try to reach consensus and we are friendly in the conversations, but to be honest we are not already established a written "decision making workflow".
