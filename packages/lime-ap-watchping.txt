== Readme
____
In MESH networks with high density of nodes, 
if a single node is working in a wrong way (bad channel, VLAN, random crash, etc.),
as the AP SSID is always the same, the client devices attached to it 
will keep trying to use it, but their network connection will be broken.

Instead, lime-ap-watchping provides a simple ICMP based watching system
which changes the AP SSID to let other working nodes handle the clients.
By default the new SSID will be $HOSTNAME-down, so it will be easy to find and fix it if possible.
Because of the layer2 batman-adv roaming feature included in LibreMesh,
clients won't even notice the difference if there is another neighbour node which can handle them.

There are two options available in /etc/config/lime config file under the lime network section:

1. autoap_enabled: [1/0] turn on/off this feature 
2. autoap_hosts: list of hosts used for watchping, usually one or more backbone nodes of the network

  Watchping hooks to change AP ssid when the network is down (i.e LibreMesh-Error).
  So the WiFi roaming is broken and the clients are not using the AP anymore until fixed.
