This is the repository of the LibreMesh web pages.

All pages should be written using asciidoc syntax

Top level pages are located in this directory while the "Documentation"
can be found in the docs/ sub-folder.

The website is generated from asciidoc using jekyll invoked by a cron script
every 15 minutes.

In order to generate the pages locally for testing your changes,
install https://jekyllrb.com/, issue "jekyll serve" and navigate to
http://127.0.0.1:4000/ with your browser.

Jekyll and its dependencies can also be installed using gem and bundler:

    gem install bundler
    cd lime-web && bundler install
    jekyll build

In Ubuntu/Debian you would need to install ruby header files

    apt-get install ruby-dev
