== Hardware

Installing LibreMesh is not always as easy as we would like to.
It depends on the router model, revision and so on.
The best way for getting an updated set of instructions is to find your
model on the link:https://openwrt.org/toh/start[OpenWRT hardware page]. However,
to cover some specific scenarios, we provide a list of articles which might help you.

Please, take into account that these pages are third-party contributed, so if
you find the opportunity expand this page with the "Edit this page" button in the upper right corner of this page.


== Suggested Hardware

Here we list some characteristics which should ensure a full compatibility with LibreMesh.
Plenty of other OpenWrt-supported devices not matching these characteristics can also be used but some of LibreMesh features could be malfunctioning.

The suggested devices have the following characteristics:

* be supported by OpenWrt 19.07;
* have at least 8 MB of flash memory;
* have at least 64 MB of RAM memory;
* have Atheros 9k radios (ath9k driver);
* have at least one 2.4 GHz radio and one 5 GHz radio;
* have at least one ethernet port labelled as LAN.

The list of devices satisfying these criteria link:https://openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_extended_all?dataflt%5BWLAN+driver_wlan-drivers*%7E%5D=ath9k&dataflt%5BSupported+Current+Rel*%7E%5D=19.07&dataflt%5BWLAN+5.0GHz*%7E%5D=n&dataflt%5BWLAN+2.4GHz*%7E%5D=n[can be found here].

Please check the device-specific installation procedure on the OpenWrt wiki, in some cases it can be prohibitively complex.

== Tested Hardware

This is a list of devices that were tested by the community and reported as fully compatible with LibreMesh, it is by no means a complete list of the working devices.
