LibreMesh Quick Starting Guide
==============================

== Compatible Hardware

It is recommended that the router has at least 8 MB of flash memory. For 4 MB routers use the special firmware named +-mini+.

These wireless routers have been tested with LibreMesh and have 8 MB of flash memory:

* TP-Link WR1043ND
* TP-Link WDR3500
* TP-Link WDR3600
* TP-Link WDR4300
* Dragino MS14
* Alix 2d2
* Ubiquiti Unifi AP
* Ubiquiti AirRouter
* Ubiquiti AirGateway
* Ubiquiti NanoStation M5 XW
* Ubiquiti NanoStation M5 XM
* Ubiquiti NanoBridge M5
* Ubiquiti NanoStation LoCo M2
* Ubiquiti PicoStation M2

Also models with 4 MB have been tested, using the +-mini+ images:

* TP-Link WR740N
* TP-Link WR741ND
* TP-Link WR841ND

For detailed information on these routers check out our link:hardware/index.html[hardware] page.

_Many other models are supported_ even if not tested yet (as far as we know), see through our firmware images at http://downloads.libremesh.org/community_chaos/16.07/[download] site.

== Flashing
link:/getit.html[Download the LiMe build] for your router. If you already have some OpenWrt like image on your Router, you must install the `-sysupgrade.bin` version. If your Router is still with the stock firmware by the manufacturer, use the `-factory` image.

=== Terminal / SSH
1. Follow the link:/docs/connecting_nodes.html[Connecting to your own node] instructions to `scp` the downloaded build onto your computer. For example `scp /LOCAL/PATH/TO/BUILD root@ROUTER_DIRECTION:/tmp/`.
* Do not try to copy to `/root`. It has limited memory access.
2. `sysupgrade -v build.bin`.
* For more information, see these http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade[OpenWRT instructions].
