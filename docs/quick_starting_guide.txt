== Flashing
link:/getit.html[Download the LiMe build] for your router. If you already have some OpenWrt like image on your Router, you must install the `-sysupgrade.bin` version. If your Router is still with the stock firmware by the manufacturer, use the `-factory` image.

=== Terminal / SSH
1. Follow the link:/docs/connecting_nodes.html[Connecting to your own node] instructions to `scp` the downloaded build onto your computer. For example `scp /LOCAL/PATH/TO/BUILD root@ROUTER_DIRECTION:/tmp/`.
* Do not try to copy to `/root`. It has limited memory access.
2. `sysupgrade -v build.bin`.
* For more information, see these http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade[OpenWRT instructions].
