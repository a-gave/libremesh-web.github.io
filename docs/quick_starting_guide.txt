LibreMesh Quick Starting Guide
==============================

== Compatible Hardware

It is recommended that the router has at least 8 MB of flash memory. For 4 MB routers use the special firmware named +-mini+.

These wireless routers have been tested with LibreMesh and have 8 MB of flash memory:

* TP-Link WR1043ND
* TP-Link WDR3500
* TP-Link WDR3600
* TP-Link WDR4300
* Dragino MS14
* Alix 2d2
* Ubiquiti Unifi AP
* Ubiquiti AirRouter
* Ubiquiti AirGateway
* Ubiquiti NanoStation M5 XW
* Ubiquiti NanoStation M5 XM
* Ubiquiti NanoBridge M5
* Ubiquiti NanoStation LoCo M2
* Ubiquiti PicoStation M2

Also models with 4 MB have been tested, using the +-mini+ images:

* TP-Link WR740N
* TP-Link WR741ND
* TP-Link WR841ND

For detailed information on these routers check out our link:hardware/index.html[hardware] page.

_Many other models are supported_ even if not tested yet (as far as we know), see through our firmware images at http://downloads.libremesh.org/community_chaos/16.07/[download] site.

== Flashing
link:/getit.html[Download the LiMe build] for your router. If you already have some OpenWrt like image on your Router, you must install the `-sysupgrade.bin` version. If your Router is still with the stock firmware by the manufacturer, use the `-factory` image.

== Installation procedure
* Find the download for your router by name or model number. You may need to search different variations or aliases. You can find more detailed router model instructions https://wiki.lede-project.org/toh/start[here].

* If you are installing for the first time, choose the link ending with `-factory.bin`. If you are upgrading an existing install, choose the link ending with `-sysupgrade.bin`.

* Once downloaded, connect your router via ethernet and log into your router's admin. First, you will need to identify the IP address for the router. You can go to the terminal use `netstat -rn` (mac), or `ip route show default` (linux), then find the IP address for the router. More details on finding your router's ip can be found http://www.howtogeek.com/233952/how-to-find-your-routers-ip-address-on-any-computer-smartphone-or-tablet/[here] and http://www.computerworld.com/article/2474776/wireless-networking/network-security-find-the-ip-address-of-your-home-router.html[here].

* Log into the router administration interface with the IP via web browser such as Firefox or Chromium: `http://<your_router_ip>/`. You may need to modify the IP by replacing the last set with 1. For example if the IP is `10.138.21.216`, try `10.138.21.1`. Another option is replacing previous set with a zero, so `10.138.21.216` would become `10.138.0.1`.

* Once you've logged in, find the `Flash new firmware image` option. 
NOTE: ensure that `Keep Settings` is UNCHECKED. It is checked by default. Then click choose file, and navigate to the location of the file you've downlaoded. Then click `Flash Image`.

=== Terminal / SSH
1. Follow the link:/docs/connecting_nodes.html[Connecting to your own node] instructions to `scp` the downloaded build onto your computer. For example `scp /LOCAL/PATH/TO/BUILD root@ROUTER_DIRECTION:/tmp/`.
* Do not try to copy to `/root`. It has limited memory access.
2. `sysupgrade -v build.bin`.
* For more information, see these http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.sysupgrade[OpenWRT instructions].
